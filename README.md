# Object_Detection
This is a Project on Object Detection using Python. I've mentioned OpenCV in this project which is very useful in Image Detection. 
Also, along with it, I've mentioned Streamlit library, which I've used to implement the model and showcase the output. 
Once we import the image files (with extensions like .jpg, .png, .jpeg), Streamlit will show us the image and then after clicking on Execute button, it'll give us the output of the count of Total Objects as well as the objects detected in a green box like this:
